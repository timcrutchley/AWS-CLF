### IAM: USERS & GROUPS >>

- **IAM** = **I**dentity and **A**ccess **M**anagement, **Global** service
- **Root account** created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- **Users** are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- **Groups** only contain users, not other groups
- **Users** don't have to belong to a group, and users can belong to multiple groups
  <br>

### IAM: PERMISSIONS >>

- **Users or Groups** can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply the **least priviledge principle**: don't give more permissions than a user needs
