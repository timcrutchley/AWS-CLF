### WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING >>

- Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
- Simple was to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services

- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, which you provision and use what you need via a web application
  <br>

### CLOUD SERVICES >>

#### GMAIL

- Email cloud service
- Pay only emails stored
  <br>

#### DROPBOX

- Cloud Storage Service
- Originally built on AWS
  <br>

#### NETFLIX

- Built on AWS
- Video on Demand
  <br>

### DEPLOYMENT MODELS OF THE CLOUD >>

#### PRIVATE CLOUD

- Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
- Security for sensitive applications
- Meet specific business needs

#### PUBLIC CLOUD

- Cloud Resources owned and operatred by a third party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
- Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- 3 Main Providers
  - Azure (Microsoft)
  - Google Cloud
  - AWS

<br>

#### HYBRID CLOUD

- Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
- Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud
  <br>

### THE FIVE CHRACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING >>

**On-demand self service:**

- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider

**Broad network access:**

- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

**Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:**

- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

**Rapid elasticity and scalability:**

- Automatically and quicjkly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand

**Measured service:**

- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

<br>

### SIX ADVANTAGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING >>

**1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)**

- Pay On-Demand: don't own hardware
  <br>

**2. Benefit from massive economies of scale**

- Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
  <br>

**3. Stop guessing capacity**

- Scale based on actual measured usage
  <br>

**4. Increased sped and agility**
<br>

**5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**
<br>

**6. Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure**
<br>

### PROBLEMS SOLVED BY THE CLOUD >>

- **Flexibility:** change resource types when needed
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** pay as you go, for what you use
- **Scalability:** accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- **Elasticity:** ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- **High-availability and fault-tolerance:** build across data centers
- **Agility:** rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
