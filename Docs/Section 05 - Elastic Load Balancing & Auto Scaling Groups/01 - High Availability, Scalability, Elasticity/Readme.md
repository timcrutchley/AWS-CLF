### SCALABILITY & HIGH AVAILABILITY >>

Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adpating

There are two kinds of scalability:
  - Verticle Scalability
  - Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)

Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

<br>

### VERTICAL SCALABILITY >>

Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance

For example, your application runs on a t2.micro

Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large

Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database

<br>

### HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY >>

Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application

Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems

This is very common for web applications / modern applications

It's easy to horizontally scale thanks to cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2
<br>

### HIGH AVAILABILITY >>

High Availability usually goes hadn in hand with horizontal scaling

High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 Availability Zones

The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss (disaster)
